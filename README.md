The Book of Buidseachd (pronounced vootsch-och, the Scottish word for witchcraft)
    is inspired by a famous wizard we all know. This project is your personal grimoire or digital book of spells. You can create, edit, or delete your own spells, as well as share and review spells created by others.

## Overview
This is a full-stack application with a React frontend and Ruby on Rails backend. It uses the bcrypt gem to authenticate and and securely encrypt passwords via cookies and sessions IDs. Authenticated users have access to a personalized homepage to manage their spells and reviews. Enhanced security ensures only logged-in users can edit their own spells and reviews. It also has the future ability for admin permissions. All the images are uploaded to Cloudinary, which can increase conversions and speed up launches. This creates a much faster experience for consumers.

## Fun Facts
All my incantations are derived from genuine Latin words or root words. I had a blast coming up with all of them. One of my favorite parts is the funny reviews, where I let my imagination run wild. There are even some spells that come with hysterical warnings and gruesome outcomes. I deliberately used a simplistic and rustic aesthetic. I wanted to keep the sense of an older more traditional book, with the charm of a mom and pop store.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Requirements

* yarn v 4.0.0
* react v 18.2.0
* react-router-dom v 6.3.0

## Installation 

* Fork and clone this repo
* On your terminal, change your directory to the name of the cloned folder (let's say the cloned folder name is 'my-cloned-app') 
    1. cd my-cloned-app
* Run the following commands in the project directory
    1. yarn install
    2. yarn start
    * This should run the app on port http://localhost:3000 or open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
    (the backend will run on port 3001)
* Follow directions for backend [https://github.com/SmithMack68/backend]





### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
